Attention Developers!\
\
We want to bring to your notice that the Developer Web API Documentation is currently lacking in detail, and there's a discrepancy with some endpoints in the V2 API, which are erroneously stated as "brickverse.co". Please be informed that we have transitioned from using the .CO TLD to the .GG TLD. Consequently, the correct URL for accessing these endpoints is now "brickverse.gg".



We apologize for any inconvenience caused by this oversight and appreciate your cooperation in updating your references accordingly. Should you have any questions or need further clarification, feel free to reach out to us. Thank you for your attention to this matter.
