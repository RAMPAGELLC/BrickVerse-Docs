# Bot Account

In order to interact with our API you must create a bot account at create.brickverse.co/bot/create or use your Account BrickVerse Security Token.\
\
Please note, BrickVerse staff advise not to use Account Token & use a bot account that we created dedicated towards this usage.\
\
Bot account session tokens do not expire on logout unless regenerated via the Bot Control menu at create.brickverse.co/bot/manage

Bot accounts have some perks & restrictions, bot accounts cannot be logged in via Login form on BrickVerse.co unless manually set via Cookie & Auth Endpoint.

Bot accounts have some upgrades, they can join up to 100 guilds, but cannot join universes or purchase from the catalog. However, bots can accept trades & send trades to friends only (this is to prevent spam), Bots have no friend limit compared to users.\
\
The Creator panel acts as an administrative panel to manage your bot. When using login() functions please declare a boolean if its a bot or not. (true for yes, false for no)\
\
Bot accounts with have a Bot tag & badge on BrickVerse.co, at any given moment in time we may suspend service of the ability to use non-bot accounts.
