# ImageLabel

An ImageLabel renders a rectangle, like a [`Frame`](frame.md) does, with an image. The image must be a decal uploaded to the BrickVerse website. The display of the image can be manipulated through the `ImageLabel.ImageColor3` and `ImageLabel.ImageTransparency` properties. To display only the image and hide the rectangle, set `GuiObject.BackgroundTransparency` to 1.
