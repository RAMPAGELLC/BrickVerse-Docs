# Boolean

A **boolean** is a very simple data type with a value of either **true** or **false**. Booleans are most commonly used with [conditional statements](conditional-structures.md), for instance:

```lua
local testBoolean = true
 
if testBoolean == true then
	-- Value of 'testBoolean' is true, so this condition is executed
else
	-- If value of 'testBoolean' is false, this condition is executed
end
```
